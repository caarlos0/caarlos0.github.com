Carlos is a software developer based in Cascavel, Brazil, currently working remotely as a Principal Site Reliability Engineer at [TOTVS Labs](https://totvslabs.com/).

While not working on his daily job, he may be hacking on [open source](https://github.com/caarlos0), [reading books](https://goodreads.com/caarlos0), lifting weights or playing some FPS (Battlefield and Call of Duty).

Carlos is interested in programming languages, containers, distributed systems, monitoring and software in general. Feel free to shoot him an [email](mailto:root@carlosbecker.dev?subject=Consultancy) if you need help with any of that. ðŸ™‚

He lives with Carine (his wife), and Zakk (a chinchilla), in [Cascavel - PR, Brazil](https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/Cascavel,+State+of+ParanÃ¡).
