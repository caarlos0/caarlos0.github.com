Carlos is a software developer based in Joinville, Brazil, currently working remotely as a [Site Reliability Engineer](https://landing.google.com/sre/interview/ben-treynor/) for [TOTVS Labs](https://totvslabs.com/).

While not working on his daily job, he may be hacking on [open source](https://github.com/caarlos0), [reading books](https://goodreads.com/caarlos0), lifting weights or playing some FPS.

Carlos is interested in programming languages, containers, distributed systems, monitoring and software in general. Feel free to shoot him an [email](mailto:root@carlosbecker.dev?subject=Consultancy) if you need help with any of that. ðŸ™‚

He lives with Carine (his wife), and Zakk (a chinchilla), in [Joinville - SC, Brazil](http://goo.gl/maps/9tvI4).
