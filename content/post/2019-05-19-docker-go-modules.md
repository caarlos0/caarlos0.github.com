Quick tip to improve the docker build speed using go modules.

<!--more-->

Normally, I would do something like this:

```dockerfile
FROM golang as builder
ENV GO111MODULE=on
WORKDIR /code
COPY . .
RUN go build -o /app main.go

FROM gcr.io/distroless/base
EXPOSE 8080
WORKDIR /
COPY --from=builder /app /usr/bin/app
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/app"]
```

The problem with this approach is that, if I change any `.go` file and rebuild,
it will download the dependencies again - which takes some time.

Taking into account that dependencies are not changed very often, we can
add a couple of lines and improve the build perfomance **a lot**:

```dockerfile
FROM golang as builder
ENV GO111MODULE=on
WORKDIR /code
COPY go.mod go.sum /code/
RUN go mod download
COPY . .
RUN go build -o /app main.go

FROM gcr.io/distroless/base
EXPOSE 8080
WORKDIR /
COPY --from=builder /app /usr/bin/app
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/app"]
```

This way, we'll only download the dependencies again if `go.mod` or `go.sum`
changed.

This can save a lot of time on local development, even more if on a slow
network connection.

That's it for today, hope it helps! ðŸ¤Ÿ
