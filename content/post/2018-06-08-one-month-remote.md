So, it has been one month since I started working fully remote. And I think I learned some things.

## What's good

There are plenty of good things I found out working fully remote:

### I magically have **more time**

This is the most important for me:

- I can have lunch with my wife every day;
- I can hit the gym either in the morning or in the end of the day;
- I can work on my personal stuff;
- I don't spend time in driving to work.

tl;dr: I have plenty of time!

### Quality time with people that matter

I'm an introvert. I don't enjoy being around a lot of people. I also don't
particularly enjoy talking with most people I know. It drains my energy.
Working remotely, I don't have to do all that social awkwardness of
"hi, good morning, how are you?" (we Brazilians do that way more than we should)
and talk to people about whatever while having coffee and all that.

Since I don't expend energy on that, I now have energy to chat more with my
wife and friends.

I will have lunch with friends that are not from work and talk about other
things than work.

I can disconnect for a while. That's great!

### I can work from whenever I want

I'm usually working from home, but I could work from whenever I want given that
I have internet access. And that's great!

## What's bad

### It's harder to "stop working"

A little of that can be because I'm work in the operations team, so, if
anything goes wrong, it doesn't matter that much what time it is.

The timezones also don't help much. I start working 4 hours earlier than part
of the team - and consequently stop working 4 hours earlier as well.
If I don't close slack, people will ping me after I already stopped working.

That may require some cultural change from me and from the rest of the team,
but so far it has been manageable.

## Lessons learned

### Don't forget your friends

It's always nice to chat with my friends and go with them to places to have
drinks and etc.

### A good chair is key
### External monitor is good
