I always wanted to know how stargazers of my repos increased over time.

I didn't found a good way of doing that, so I wrote an app for thatâ„¢.

The app stack is simple:

- go 1.8+
- glide
- gorilla/mux
- apex/log
- go-chart
- go-redis
- heroku

It is live at [starchart.cc](https://starchart.cc) and the code is OpenSource at [caarlos0/starcharts](https://github.com/caarlos0/starcharts).

The charts look like this one:
