I'm working in a project that uses Chef, and it have a lot of JSON files.
I like everything to be preperly formatted. The choice of format itself
does not bother me too much, since there is one.
This project did not.

<!--more-->

So, I decided to properly format all files. The first thing that came to mind
was [Prettier][prettier], but I would rather have something statically
compiled and that don't need to install 3k dependencies.

I could also use `jq`, but to do all I wanted to do (auto write changes,
print the diff and etc) it would require some probably ugly shell scripting.
Also not as fun as writing my own tool.

So, I searched for `jsonfmt` (as I thought that would be the obvious name),
but found only half backed and abandoned things.

At this point I was like "duh it must be easy let me write this thing".

I decided to use Go because I'm used to it and it has been great to write
CLI tools using it.

## First attempt

My first thought was to unmarshal to a `map[string]interface{}` and then
marshal it back, something like:

```go
var tmp map[string]interface{}
_ := json.Unmarshal(input, &tmp)
output, _ := json.MarshalIndent(tmp, "", "  ")
```

To my surprise, it reorder all keys.

The JSON spec does not define key order, so we shouldn't depend on it. While
it's ok and we don't, it would reformat all files differently every time I run
then, so, not what I wanted...

## Second attempt

Searching for things like `json keep order golang` I came across the
the [ordered-json](https://github.com/virtuald/go-ordered-json) lib,
and tried to use it:

```go
var tmp json.OrderedObject
_ := json.Unmarshal(input, &tmp)
output, _ := json.MarshalIndent(tmp, "", "  ")
```

Now the root keys order were kept, but inner structures had the same issue
as before.

## Third attempt

I decided to step back and take another look at the JSON package docs instead
of trusting my memory, and remembered that `json.RawMessage` exists. It seamed
reasonable to me that it would not mess around with the order of the keys,
so I tried it out:

```go
var tmp json.RawMessage
_ := json.Unmarshal(input, &tmp)
output, _ := json.MarshalIndent(tmp, "", "  ")
```

And **BOOM**, it works!

But is it good enough? Do I really need to unmarshal and then marshal back?

## Fourth attempt

Read the docs for a little while, and found about the `json.Indent` method.
That seems to be it! Let's give it a try:

```go
var out bytes.Buffer
_ = json.Indent(&out, input, "", "  ")
```

And it works almost perfectly: it keeps extra empty lines in the end of the
file.

We can fix that by trimming the whitespaces of the input:

```go
var out bytes.Buffer
_ = json.Indent(&out, bytes.TrimSpace(input), "", "  ")
```

And finally, we may add an empty line to the end of the file:

```go
out.Write([]byte{'\n'})
```

And that's it!

Once again, the best solution was simpler than all others!

## How am I using it

So, basically I have something like this on my makefile:

```makefile
fmt:
	jsonfmt -w

check:
	jsonfmt
```

On the CI, I run `make check` and locally I run `make fmt` (on `pre-commit`).

So, I can have everything on the same formatting, and if someone does not
follow the rule, the CI build will fail and print the differences.

## Can I have it?

Sure you can! The code is OpenSource and can be found on [GitHub][gh].

You can also install it using several methods:

**homebrew**:

```sh
brew install caarlos0/tap/jsonfmt
```

**snapcraft**:

```sh
snap install jsonfmt
```

**docker**:

```sh
docker run -v $PWD:/data --workdir /data caarlos0/jsonfmt -h
```

**deb/rpm**:

Download the `.deb` or `.rpm` from the [releases page][releases] and
install with `dpkg -i` and `rpm -i` respectively.

**manually**:

Download the pre-compiled binaries from the [releases page][releases] or
clone the repo build from source.

## That's all folks
