Sometimes people ask me what my setup looks like for remote work. I decided to try to keep a list of the hardware I'm currently using. Hope you'll find this useful, somehow.

<!--more-->

> **PS**: I will try to keep this up to date, but I won't promise anything. ðŸ˜Œ

## How it looks like

{{< figure caption="My setup ðŸ˜Œ(a little outdated)" src="/public/images/setup/d8b10ca9-4d7b-48da-aab3-ab174d862cdf.png" >}}

I use the MacBook on clamshell mode (closed) because I don't like to manage
multiple screens (sue me) and the screen is already big enough. ðŸ˜Œ

## Machine

Its a [MacBook Pro](https://amzn.to/2GAaGBm) 15", from 2017.

It has a **3.1 GHz** Intel Core i7, **16 GB** of memory and a **2 TB** SSD disk.

Its more than enough for a couple of years I think.

## Keyboard / Mouse

Mouse is a [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Master-Advanced-Wireless-Mouse/dp/B07XC2FWD1/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=mx+master+3&qid=1600798679&refinements=p_89%3ALogitech%2Cp_n_condition-type%3A6461716011&rnid=6461714011&sr=8-1) and the keyboard is a [Logitech MX Keys](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Advanced-Wireless-Illuminated-Keyboard/dp/B07XD3VS62/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=mx+keys&qid=1600798730&sr=8-3).

## Display

Recently changed to a [Dell U2718Q](https://amzn.to/3aNRbDb), 27", 4K, IPS. 

And it is **awesome**. ðŸ¤©

Before that I used a [LG 23PM55](https://www.lg.com/za/monitors/lg-23MP55HQ), 23", IPS. Not nearly as cool as the current one.

## Headphones

Currently, I'm using a [Bose QC35 II](https://amzn.to/2S0eYqN). 

It has Active NC and all that. It's pretty good to listen music and work without hearing my wife calling me (don't @ me) or someone knocking.

Before that, I had the AirPods 1st generation, but I accidentally washed them - and now they're dead.

## Others

- Generic Headphone stand
- Corsair gaming mouse pad, similar to [this one](https://amzn.to/313Zmqm)
- [Cable Matters USB-C â†’ DisplayPort](https://amzn.to/394xZiG) cable ([see this post about why](https://carlosbecker.dev/posts/macos-4k-display))
- [Webcam Logitech C270](https://amzn.to/2tdcj4O) (I use the mac in clamshell mode)

## Retired hardware

I used to use a [Magic Keyboard 2](https://amzn.to/3aYGP3x) and a [Magic Trackpad 2](https://amzn.to/2t5phRU), retired in favor of the Logitech MX Master 3 and MX Keys.
