Sometimes people ask me what my setup looks like for remote work.

I will try to keep this up to date, but I won't promise anything. ðŸ˜Œ

Here's how it looks like:

I use the MacBook on clamshell mode (closed) because I don't like to manage
multiple screens (sue me).

## Machine

Its a [MacBook Pro](https://amzn.to/2GAaGBm) 15", from 2017.

## Keyboard / Mouse

[Magic Keyboard 2](https://amzn.to/3aYGP3x) and a [Magic Trackpad 2](https://amzn.to/2t5phRU).

## Display

Recently changed to a [Dell U2718Q](https://amzn.to/3aNRbDb), 27", 4K, IPS.

## Headphones

[Bose QC35 II](https://amzn.to/2S0eYqN) (has Active NC and all that).

## Others

- Generic Headphone stand
- Corsair gaming mouse pad, similar to [this one](https://amzn.to/313Zmqm)
- [Apple USB-C adapter](https://amzn.to/38RfGxu) (does not support 4k @ 60Hz, need to change it)

## Next buys

- [Webcam Logitech C270](https://amzn.to/2tdcj4O): need it for meetings, right now I have to open the mac, which is annoying;
- [USB-C -> Micro DisplayPort cable](https://amzn.to/2vzQmxF): I want my display to run in 4K @ 60Hz.
