[Watchub][wh] is a service that notifies you of people who followed/unfollowed
you and starred/unstarred your repositories.

It runs every day and sends you an email if something changed.

The first commit was about 1 month ago, and I first deployed it to
production exactly 1 month ago.

Since then have sent **~200** emails to **~30** users!

I guess this is a good number, considering I didn't promote it a lot (just
to some friends and coworkers). Thank you all!

In order to keep the product growing,
[@marcelinhov2](https://github.com/marcelinhov2) is joining me to help with
the front end and email design, so, expect the app to not look like a
backend did it anymore. :laughing:

We'll also add more features, like fork notifications, for example.

So, thanks for everyone using [Watchub][wh], hope you continue enjoying it.
